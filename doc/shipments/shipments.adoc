Shipments are being created in order to place a request for the advise of possibly multiple <<Parcels>> via a carrier. When creating a shipment the fulfillmenttools platform takes care of creating the amount of packages the shipment requires, advising those against the selected carrier and serves as a resource that bundles the information of the corresponding packages.

=== Provided information to a Shipment

When creating a shipment you have to provide a reference to an existing pickjob for a facility the user is also assigned to (see <<Roles and permissions>>).
