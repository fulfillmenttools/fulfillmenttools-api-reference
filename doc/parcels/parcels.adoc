== Parcels
image::doc/parcels/DocParcelsOverview.png[align="center"]

Parcels are (in contrast to <<Shipments>>) the representation of physical packages that are handed over to carriers. A parcel resource has its own lifecycle, which is decoupled from the lifecycle of the (possibly) connected shipment.

After a successful advise to a carrier, which will be done asynchronously by the platform, it will bear the information about status, tracking number and the link to the downloadable parcel label that has to be attached to the package.
