== Users

In the fulfillmenttools platform there is a simple yet effective rights & permission system in place. It hides data from users, that are authenticated but not authorized to view data or it disables to use features in API, backoffice or mobile clients.

=== Roles and permissions

There is a fixed set of roles a user can possess within the platform. Currently the system knows the following roles:

[[bookmark-roles_table]]
.Available Roles in fulfillmenttools
|===
|Role |Facility affiliation

|FULFILLER
|yes

|SUPERVISOR
|yes

|ADMINISTRATOR
|no

|===

A user always has to possess a known role in order to interact with the clients or via the API.
This information is issued to the Identity-Provider and will be reflected in the next JWT, that is issued to the user.

TIP: Only information that comes within the signed JWT token is considered for authorization in the platform. That also means, that for example
a role change can take *up to 60 minutes* for a user to become visible, because already issued JWT Tokens still remain valid.
You can force acquiring a new role for example by asking the user to logout and login again.

Currently there is a 1:1 relationship between a user and a role: Any given user in the system can have exactly one role.
The existing roles are sharing permissions and implement a concept of inheritance which is shown in the following diagram:

==== Facility affiliation

In order to prevents user of specific roles to read out data that they are not allowed to see (for GDPR reasons for instance)
some roles are only assignable together with a mandatory reference to a facility (see <<bookmark-roles_table,table>>).

IMPORTANT: Currently the list of available roles is fixed and cannot be extended by the client.

=== Use Cases
The following calls are allowed to the following roles: SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATOR

NOTE: SUPERVISORS can only manage users within their assigned facility while ADMINISTRATORS can manage users for any existing facility.

IMPORTANT: Role changes to users can only be done by users that have enough rights. In other words: A `SUPERVISOR` can not make another user an `ADMINISTRATOR`

==== Deleting a user
[source,curl]
----
curl --request DELETE 'https://{host}}/api/users/x5jrZrDHvYYs6HpaDICKYG4QuIk2' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <Valid idToken>'

Response:

IMPORTANT: When a user is deleted all currently active JWT Tokens of said user are invalidated. The user will not be able to use an issued token anymore.
