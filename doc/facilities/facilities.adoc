== Facilities
image::doc/facilities/DocFacilitiesOverview.png[align="center"]

This resource describes the stores, warehouses, popup stores, etc. of a company. In general, a facility is a place where fulfillment processes take place or should be considered.

The facilities in our platform have some basic data to them: an address, provided services, etc.. They are also an important component of the Distributing Order Management System: an <<Orders,Order>> and a facility are combined into a <<Pickjobs,Pickjob>> which is then picked to fulfill the consumers' order.

The api offers a delete endpoint. Handle with care as the call will delete every data related to the facility such as
listings and configurations.

=== Configurations

A facility is, similar to a couple of other entities in the platform, configurable.
The configurations for a facility are accessible via
link:https://fulfillmenttools.github.io/api-reference-ui/#/Facilities/getFacilityConfigurations[Get configurations for a facility]. The reponse to a request to this resource will contain a list of set / available configurations to the depicted facility.

A facility can have some specific restrictions regarding stock. In a first version the available parameters for stock in a facility can be found within the next section.

==== Stock Configuration

Since a tenant might have ongoing offline sales (caused by offline consumers who walk into the facility and buy certain articles), we have to deal with the uncertainty that there will be stock which we cannot use for online orders.
Furthermore we have to deal with the fact that the reported stock is not 100% correct for each given moment in time.

Therefore we “split” the stock of each article into offline and online stock and reserve a certain stock level for offline sales. The Distributing Order Management System will not include any of this offline stock into its calculations.

The reserved offline stock for a facility can be obtained, enabled or disabled by using the link:https://fulfillmenttools.github.io/api-reference-ui/#/Facilities/getFacilityStockConfiguration[Get Facility Stock Configuration] endpoint.

This configuration can be enabled for facilties of type STORE while facilities of type WAREHOUSE do not have visiting offline consumers and thus do not need this configuration. Once the reserved offline stock is set, it is taken into consideration for every *new order* that is supplied to the platform - existing pickjobs that were routed beforehand are not reprocessed.

NOTE: In the first iteration stage the retained offline stock needs to be set manually by defining a relative quantity ( % ) for offline stock with a decimal value between 0 and 100. The calculated offline stock is rounded off. Since the level for offline stock could vary for each facility (e.g. facilities in pedestrian zones should have a higher offline stock level than a facility outside the city) it is configurable by facility.

=== Listings

A listing describes the general availability of an article in <<Facilities>> or, to be more precise, within one facility. It also contains facility-dependend
information like the article image, title and its price.
This information is essential for the Distributing Order Management System as an order should be ideally routed to a facility
which has all requested articles in stock.

A tenant can also be configured to have *infiniteStockEnabled* which means that when distributing an order only the
state of a listing and not the actual amount of stock is considered. if a short pick is detected and the
*infiniteStockEnabled* toggle is active the short picked article's listing is deactivated. By default every deactivated
listing is reactivated again after 24 hours.
This behaviour can be configured on a facility base by setting the configuration *listingReactivationAfter* (in hours)
using the link:https://fulfillmenttools.github.io/api-reference-ui/#/Facilities/getFacilityStockConfiguration[Get Facility Stock Configuration] endpoint.

==== Introducing Picking Sequence
It is possible to sort the pick line items and show them in an order in the app. This enhances the picking speed of the picker since the items are presented to them in the correct running order.

This can be done by providing a `PickingSequence` attribute of a listing. If more than one pick line item has the same `PickingSequence`, `tenantArticleId` will be used for the sorting.

Note: Listing's `PickingSequence` attribute will override Order's `PickingSequence` attribute.

        {
            "tenantArticleId": "2020249",

            "stockinformation": {

                "category": "pickingSequence", // Category must be set to `PickingSequence`
                "priority": 1, // This property will be taken into account if there are multiple `PickingSequence` attributes defined for one listing, otherwise you can leave it 
                "key": "pickingSequence",
                "value": "1" // This is the value that sorts the article.  The sorting is being done in an ascending way, so the value 1 will be on top of others.
                }
            ]
        }
    ]

==== Stock

An even further refined way to distribute an order is to consider the actual available stock of an article within a facility, namely a listing. This is why listings have attributes that in turn have impact on the distribution of orders and transforming them to pickjobs. Currently the following attributes are available:

* *Stock*: This value depicts the amount of articles that is currently on stock. It is an absolute number and ist not taking reserved or offline retained stock into account.
* *Reserved*: Reserved stock is the amount of articles, that is already planned to be used in OPEN Pick Line Items of Pickjobs. Whenever a new order arrives in the system the reserved value for the listing of the corresponding facility and article is being raised, whenever a Pickjob is finished the amount is substracted again.
* *Retained Offline Stock*: See <<Stock Configuration>>
