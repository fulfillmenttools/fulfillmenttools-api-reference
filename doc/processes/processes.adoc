== Processes

A Process is the entity that serves as a container around the tenant specific fulfillment process.

The process entity could be used to solve at least two challenges:

* Anonymization of entities: GDPR

* Provide a “signpost” to give a good answer to the question “Where do we stand in the Fulfillment for order XYZ” by doing a single call.

A process entity is created by the creation of an order, pickjob, shipment and handover. A process is retrievable via REST- and GraphQL-API. It cannot be created via API as it is created indirectly by the creation of an entity that is part of the fulfillment process of the tenant.

A process has a property called gdprCleanupDate. When this date is reached, all entities belonging to this Process will be anonymized.
